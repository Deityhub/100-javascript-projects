when installing, got the following `WARN`s:

pm WARN @indeed/eslint-plugin-indeed@5.0.0 requires a peer of eslint@4.x but none was installed.
npm WARN @indeed/eslint-plugin-indeed@5.0.0 requires a peer of eslint-plugin-react@7.x but none was installed.


npm run lint: Run the linter, using cached results for unmodified files, and reporting only errors.

npm run lint-fix: Run the linter, auto-fixing any errors that ESLint knows how to fix.

npm run lint-warn: Run the linter, using cached results for unmodified files, and reporting both errors and warnings.
